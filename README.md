# McAfee ESM Field Names

After I understood that the enrichment fields in the ESM can overwrite other existing fields I decided to create a simple python app to search for a field by its name and the app will search for other fields with the same field id and return their names, super fast and super easy to use and hopefully will save some time and headache.

Written in Python 3.7.4

Enjoy and feel free to ask!
